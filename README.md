## 🧩 Key Elements in a Wireframe

Wireframes are visual guides that represent the skeletal structure of a user interface (UI). They help in planning and communicating design ideas before development begins. Below are the key elements commonly found in wireframes:

### 1. **Layout Structure**
Defines the overall arrangement of components on a page.

**Example:**  
A homepage might have a three-part layout — header (logo + navigation), body (main content), and footer (contact info + links). This structure ensures content is organized and easy to follow.

### 2. **Navigation**
Represents menus, links, or buttons that help users move between pages or sections.

**Example:**  
A wireframe may include a top navigation bar with links like “Home,” “Services,” “Contact,” and “Login.” This improves usability and helps users find information quickly.

### 3. **Content Placement**
Indicates where key information or media will be displayed within the layout.

**Example:**  
Placing a prominent banner with a welcome message at the top-center of the homepage ensures users immediately see the main purpose of the site.

### 4. **Functionality**
Outlines interactive elements like buttons, search bars, sliders, forms, etc.

**Example:**  
A “Book Now” button in a hotel booking system wireframe shows where users will initiate the booking process, making functionality clear during the design phase.

Wireframes help designers, developers, and stakeholders align on structure and usability **before** moving into visual design and coding.

## 🗂️ Types of Wireframes

Wireframes can be categorized based on their level of detail and functionality. The two main types are:

### 1. **Low-Fidelity Wireframes**
Low-fidelity (lo-fi) wireframes are basic, simplified sketches or mockups. They focus on layout, structure, and flow without including design elements like colors, fonts, or detailed content.

**Characteristics:**
- Simple shapes (boxes, lines, placeholders)
- No color or styling
- Often hand-drawn or created using basic tools
- Focuses on structure and layout

**When to Use:**
- Early stages of the design process
- Brainstorming and idea validation
- Quick feedback and iteration

### 2. **High-Fidelity Wireframes**
High-fidelity (hi-fi) wireframes are detailed and closer to the final product. They include specific design elements, real content, interactions, and even early usability logic.

**Characteristics:**
- Uses real text and images
- Shows exact placement and spacing
- Includes visual design elements (color, font, UI components)
- May simulate interactions or flows

**When to Use:**
- Later stages of design
- Client presentations and stakeholder reviews
- Preparing for handoff to developers

## 🧐 What Type of Wireframe is This?

**Type:** `🔲 <Insert image or wireframe name here>`

**Explanation:**  
_This wireframe is an example of a **[Low-Fidelity / High-Fidelity]** wireframe because it **[explain features: e.g., uses placeholders and basic layout without detailed design]**. It is typically used during the **[early/late]** stages of the design process to **[purpose: validate ideas / finalize UI before development]**._
