## 🧩 Key Elements in a Wireframe

Wireframes are visual guides that represent the skeletal structure of a user interface (UI). They help in planning and communicating design ideas before development begins. Below are the key elements commonly found in wireframes:

### 1. **Layout Structure**
Defines the overall arrangement of components on a page.

**Example:**  
A homepage might have a three-part layout — header (logo + navigation), body (main content), and footer (contact info + links). This structure ensures content is organized and easy to follow.

### 2. **Navigation**
Represents menus, links, or buttons that help users move between pages or sections.

**Example:**  
A wireframe may include a top navigation bar with links like “Home,” “Services,” “Contact,” and “Login.” This improves usability and helps users find information quickly.

### 3. **Content Placement**
Indicates where key information or media will be displayed within the layout.

**Example:**  
Placing a prominent banner with a welcome message at the top-center of the homepage ensures users immediately see the main purpose of the site.

### 4. **Functionality**
Outlines interactive elements like buttons, search bars, sliders, forms, etc.

**Example:**  
A “Book Now” button in a hotel booking system wireframe shows where users will initiate the booking process, making functionality clear during the design phase.

Wireframes help designers, developers, and stakeholders align on structure and usability **before** moving into visual design and coding.
